<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Data Collection & Use</strong><br />
  QuizGPT does <strong>not collect, track, or transmit</strong> any personal information. All configuration (such as the OpenAI API key, model selection, and click preferences) is stored <strong>locally</strong> in your browser using Chrome's <code>storage.local</code> API.</p>

<p><strong>Third-party Services</strong><br />
  QuizGPT does not use any external analytics or data tracking. If you enable optional payments in the future (e.g., via Stripe or ExtensionPay), their respective privacy policies will apply. At the moment, QuizGPT does not integrate any external payment system.</p>

<p><strong>Data Storage</strong><br />
  Your API key and preferences remain on your local device. Nothing is sent to any backend server operated by us.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to This Policy</strong><br />
  We may update this policy. Changes will be reflected here and dated accordingly.</p>
